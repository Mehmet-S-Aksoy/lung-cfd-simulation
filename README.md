# Thesis Validation

This simulation serves as a validation step for my Master's thesis titled:  
**"CFD Simulation of Aerosol Deposition in Human Lungs"**  
at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB).

The objective is to verify the reliability and accuracy of the CFD model by reproducing established benchmark data.  
The validated setup will be used for further studies involving parameter variations and optimization using machine learning techniques.


## Key Aspects:

- Geometry based on a simplified human airway model
- Mesh refinement and quality assessment
- Comparison of particle deposition using the Discrete Phase Model (DPM) with published literature
- Solver settings and boundary conditions, including User Defined Functions (UDFs), aligned with validation standards



## Tools Used

- ANSYS Fluent 2024 R2 (CFD setup, DPM modeling)
- ANSYS Meshing / SpaceClaim (geometry and mesh)
- Excel (graph plotting, validation comparison)
